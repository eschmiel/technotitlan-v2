Plan for new position system.
-- 6/10/23 

Adjacency lists seem like the go to data structures for representing graphs and facilitating their traversal.

Adjacency list representing each position and the positions adjacent to them.

In this case, our nodes are our positions.

two dimensional array for allowing position index lookup by coordinates

positionCoordinates array allowing coordinates look up by position index

WHY DO WE NEED THESE?

- Coordinates 
- - help determine spatial relationships between positions i.e. is a node above, to the left, below or to the right of another node.
- - Lets us know where a position is on the screen, so we know what screen coordinates to draw an object at the given position.
- Adjacency List
- - Easily determine paths and distance between positions.

- Spatial Relationships
- - Navigating the selector. 
- - - The selector is supposed to move between positions according to a given a spatial relationship in response to controller input,
- - - even if that position doesn't exist as a node on the graph.
- Drawing
- - We need a way to compute the screen coordinates to draw something at a given node.

- Units should exist at graphPosition. The selector should exist at screenPosition.

TO-DO

- Take map data and build graph data structure out of it
