We need:

- to be able to traverse a graph of navigable spaces and see available movements options in range
- to be able to traverse a graph of ALL spaces and highlight any navigable ones in attack range.

Need a graph module that can build the correct adjacency list and maintain its own mapPositionToGraphPosition table.
